# Lesson 02 - Introduction to Storyboards


## Lesson Objectives

* Add multiple View Controllers to storyboard and link them together with segues
* Use Navigation Controller to link scenes
* Differentiate between storyboards and nibs


## Lesson Plan

### Hackulator Example Project

* A tour of Hackulator. (30 min)
* Structure of the code.
* Interface Builder files
    * Main storyboard
    * NIBs
* Q+A


### Mobile App Design

Go over terminology and paradigms of mobile app design. (30 min)

* How is mobile different?
    * Less UI real estate
    * Wide range of devices
    * Touch gestures
    * Usage context
    * Network latency
* Gestural Interfaces

* Mobile Design Patterns
    * Navigation
    * Screen-level actions
    * User onboarding
    * Lists, filtering, and empty sets
    * Dialog boxes

### Terminology overview

* Views (review)
* View Controllers
* Navigation Controllers
* Scenes

### Introducing Storyboards

* Like website sitemaps.
* Show the entire flow of an app or a portion of an app

A warning about Interface Builder and Storyboards:

There’s a lot of flexibility in Storyboards. Unfortunately, there aren’t many “guardrails” to keep you from doing stuff that simply doesn’t work. In addition, the critical-path features that we need are often obscure and hidden away.

### Website sitemaps

Sitemaps that web designers draw show the structure of the site and describe the “flow” from one page to another.

### Draw a Website Site Map

In pairs, draw a website site map of a website you know, something simple.

### Build a Storyboard App

Build a "vanity app" of yourself, your bio, goals, etc.

We’ll review a few of the views we’ve used before, talk about their “attributes,” and play around a bit more.

We'll also be going over navigation bars, button, _static_ table views, text fields, text views.
