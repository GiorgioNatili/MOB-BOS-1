var name:String = "Bo-Huei Lin"
var age:Int = 30


// TODO: Print "Hello {whatever the value of name is}, you are {whatever the value of age is} years old!"

println("Hello \(name), you are \(age) years old!")

// TODO: Print the first fifty multiples of seven minus one (e.g. the first three multiples are 7, 14, 21. The first three multiples minus one are 6, 13, 20)

// TODO: Print out "Hello {whatever the value of name is}, your name is {however long the string name is} characters long!. Use countElements()

var characters = count(name)

println("Hello \(name), your name is \(characters) characters long!!.")




// TODO: Print the sum of one hundred random numbers. Use rand() to generate random numbers.

//let random = (rand() % 100)

//for var r=0; r<100; r++ {
//    println((rand() % 100))
//}

//let sum = [r]

//total = sum.reduce(0, combine:+)


//println("The Sum of one hundred random numbers are: \(sum)")





// Bonus TO DO: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

} else if (i % 3 == 0) && (i % 5 == 0) {
        println("FizzBuzz")
}
}


// BONUS TODO: The first fibonacci number is 0, the second is 1, the third is 1, the fourth is two, the fifth is 3, the sixth is 5, etc. The Xth fibonacci number is the sum of the X-1th fibonacci number and the X-2th fibonacci number. Print the 37th fibonacci number below
